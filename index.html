        <p>I am a new web developer with a ton of experience in other fields. I have spent the last 10 years in client facing roles in the hospitality, sales and energy sectors. With the last 4 years as remote work. I am not looking to return to my tech roots.</p>
        <p>I am a very outgoing person and I love to nerd out.  I enjoy talking shop, sports and everything in between.  My easy going manner is very helpful in relaxing clients that are frustrated or nervous.</p>
        <p>My sense of humor is light hearted and goofy.  I find it funny to make the favicon on the top of this webpage my headshot.  </p>
        <p>And even funnier that you just looked.</p>
        <p>This is just a holder website while I finish up my proper one.  Please feel free to reach out to me at <a href="mailto:arnold.trey80@gmail.com?Subject=Hello" target="_top">my email</a> in the meantime.</p>
        <p>Thanks for stopping by!</p>
